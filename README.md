# Coding Test Programs

This repository contains solutions to a coding test using the **Python** programming language.

## Programs

### Program-1.py
A simple calculator implemented using a class, which supports:
- Addition
- Subtraction
- Multiplication
- Division

**Inputs**:
- `a` (float)
- `b` (float)
- `operation` (string)

The calculator takes inputs from the user and displays the result.

### Program-2.py
Generates the first `x` odd numbers based on user input.

**Example**:
- Input: `4`
- Output: `1, 3, 5, 7`

---

### Program-3.py
Generates a series of odd numbers based on these rules:
- If the input number `a` is **odd**, print the first `a` odd numbers.
- If `a` is **even**, print the first `a - 1` odd numbers.

**Example**:
- Input: `4`
- Output: `1, 3, 5`
- Input: `6`
- Output: `1, 3, 5, 7, 9`

## How to Run

Make sure you have **Python** installed.

From the command line:
```bash
